I’m Jeanine, a Master's student in Computer Science at **UC Davis** and a member of **Laboratory for AI, Robotics, and Automation (LARA)**. I am currently researching foveated world models, and SLAM and NeRF rechniques for retina OCT imaging.

My broader research interests focus on efficient **visual representations** and **active vision**, particularly how adaptive perception mechanisms support world modeling, long-horizon interaction, and decision making in embodied systems.

I graduated from the University of Toronto in June 2025, with an Honors Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Math, with Distinction. During my undergraduate years, I have taken many interesting courses in computer science and math like computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, linear optimzation and many more. I have had the privilege of working closely with and learning from several renowned professors and researchers across diverse disciplines. These include [Prof. David Rokeby](http://www.davidrokeby.com/) (BAFTA winner, machine learning and body motion), [Prof. Caroline Blais](http://lpvs-uqo.ca/en/directeurs/caroline-blais/) (UQO, vision and perception psychology), and [Prof. Nandita Vijaykumar](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nandita/) (machine learning and systems).

Outside of school, I enjoy watching movies and anime series, and reading manga! My favorite movie is John Wick (Chapters 1-4) and my favorite anime series is Bleach. I'm currently reading (and enjoying) Jujustu Kaisen Modulo.

I’m always interested in collaborating on research in active vision and embodied world modeling. If our interests align, feel free to reach out!
