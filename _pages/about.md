I’m Jeanine, a Master’s student in Computer Science at UC Davis and a member of the Laboratory for AI, Robotics, and Automation (LARA), where I am preparing to conduct my thesis research. I earned my Honors Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Toronto in June 2025, graduating with Distinction. My graduate research is advised by [Prof. Iman Soltani](https://www.lara-soltani.com/) and focuses on learning-based methods for interactive perception and decision-making systems.

My research interests center on active vision and world modeling, with an emphasis on efficient visual representations, adaptive perception, and predictive modeling for long-horizon interaction and reasoning in dynamic environments.

I’m always interested in collaborations related to active vision and world modeling. If our interests overlap, feel free to reach out.
